chemart is an open chemistry database at the National Iinstituonal (NIH). “Open” means that you can put your scientific data in chemart trading and that others may use it. Since the launch in 2004, chemart trading has become a key chemical information resource for scientists, students, and the general public. Each month our website and programmatic services provide data to several million users worldwide.<br><br>

chemart trading mostly contains small molecules, but also larger molecules such as nucleotides, carbohydrates, lipids, peptides, and chemically-modified macromolecules. We collect information on chemical structures, identifiers, chemical and physical properties, biological activities, patents, health, safety, toxicity data, and many others.<br><br>

Where does the data in chemart trading come from? chemart trading records are contributed by hundreds of data sources. Examples include: government agencies, chemical vendors, journal publishers, and more.<br><br>

The amount of data in chemart trading is ever-growing, please visit the chemart trading Statistics page to find out what the latest data counts are.<br><br>

chemart trading and the NCBI Entrez Interface<br>
In the past, the majority of our users found it very difficult to navigate between multiple Entrez text search interfaces (one had to use a separate Entrez interface for compounds, substances, and bioassays), a separate structure search interface, the content pages, and the homepage. Additionally, Entrez does not support content that was added to chemart trading later, such as patents.

In order to provide a better user experience, we created a unified chemical search interface that supports text search across all chemart trading data collections as well as structure and molecular formula search. This unified search interface is found on the chemart trading homepage.

chemart trading still provides an interface to Entrez. From the search interface, one can click "Use Entrez" and select from one of the three Entrez databases. Alternatively, one can navigate directly to the database of interest and access it there. They are also found here using one of the three links below:
<br>
chemart trading Compound in Entrez<br>
chemart trading Substance in Entrez<br>
chemart trading BioAssay in Entrez<br>
The chemart trading Entrez database interfaces have some powerful features that are not available in chemart trading's search interface, such as a large array of indexes and filters combined with a powerful query language.
